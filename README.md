# PJM-Hourly-Energy-Consumption-Forecasting-through-Machine-Learning
This is the final project of my graduate level course DS675-854 Machine Learning at NJIT.

This project requires a dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption/data.

My main contributions are listed inside of the project: I did most of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and XGBoost fine tuning (primarily the work on the PJM_Load_Forecasting_ML_Final_Project_EDA_+_XGB_focus_file.ipynb file). I also made sure that our data followed a valid train/validation/test split so that we did not end up encorporating data from the 'future'. I was able to leverage my background in economics to do things such as autocorrelation testing and stationarity testing to make sure that we could go into model building properly.
